// I'd like to use environmental justice/racism data preferably since it is the topic I've been most interested in during my time here.
// I am not sure how to get the data however.
// In GIS, it was relatively easy. We'd get .csv data to analyze, then get a shapefile.
// When it comes to this type of data analysis and mngt, I'm not sure what files to get.
// Do we just get any data and the goal is to transcribe the data in STATA?
// I have read articles detailing environmental injustice in states like Louisiana, and I'm sure there's aggregate data out there that details the problem.
// But what files (specifically file extensions) can we open and analyze in STATA?
