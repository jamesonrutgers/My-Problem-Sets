/* 
My research into COVID in the Mid-Atlantic primarily looks into the possible
correlations between COVID cases (and deaths) with race, population, and poverty.
I find that the strongest correlation between Covid cases and deaths is population,
and particularly population density (although pop density merge is giving me some
new trouble, trouble which I had not had in previous problem sets). However,
there is some correlation with race, more so than poverty. I have found areas with
both high population as well as high proportions of black people tend to see
the highest covid numbers.
For the final, I have added data from several large counties across the United
States, including Los Angeles, Harris (Houston), Dallas, Bexar (San Antonio), and
Miami-Dade Counties. I find that targeting large, diverse counties has both benefits
and drawbacks to the research.

On one hand, large counties provide ample opportunities to research correlations
between race, poverty, and COVID deaths and cases. However, large counties may
obscure some important information. For instance, it is difficult to understand
whether COVID cases and mortality are correlated more with population/pop. density
or race and poverty. This is why I also wanted to look at low-pop counties with
high poverty rates, such as Cumberland, NJ. 

For this final, I have added high-poverty, low-population majority
black counties, such as those in Mississippi and Louisiana. However, for May 3,
I want to compare these counties to majority white counties with VERY similar
populations, not just approximated.

Problems remaining that need to be rectified for the May 3rd submission:
- Issues with population density (may just drop)
- Repetition. Have experimented with loops but need more work on them.

have large numbers of black residents, but it may be more illucidating in terms
of analyzing correlations to include counties such as Washington, MS, and comparing
